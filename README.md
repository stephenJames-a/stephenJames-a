## Hey, I'm Stephen

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring IT support specialist, but I'm really aiming for **DevOps/SysAdmin**, as I'm finding it more within my reach. I love UNIX-like systems and I love to spend my free time learning and growing my skills.

## What I'm About

- Learning full-stack IT: support, networking, DevOps, & automation
- Comfortable with Linux, FreeBSD, and other UNIX-like environments
- Python and Bash scripting + CLI utilities are my thing
- Exploring system tools such as ZFS, containers, and infra-as-code (IaC)
- Studying for an IT career.
